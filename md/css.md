# <color>

### Color

The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations, and sets the <currentcolor> value. currentcolor may be used as an indirect value on other properties and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color.

```css
color: rebeccapurple;
color: #00ff00;
```
